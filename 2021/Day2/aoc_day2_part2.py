You find the submarine manual and discover that the process is actually slightly more complicated.        In addition to horizontal position and depth, you'll also need to track a third value, aim, which also starts at 0. The commands also mean something entirely different than you first thought:        - down X increases your aim by X units.    - up X decreases your aim by X units.    - forward X does two things:        It increases your horizontal position by X units.        It increases your depth by your aim multiplied by X."""# pas recommandé, mais autorisé par le langagenb_élèves = 12print(nb_élèves)DIRECTIONS = {'forward': (1, 0), 'up': (0, -1), 'down': (0, 1)}x, y, aim = 0, 0, 0while True:    try:        direction, move = input().split()        move = int(move)        if direction == 'forward':            dx, dy = DIRECTIONS[direction]            x += move * dx            y += move * aim        else:            aim = aim - move if direction == 'up' else aim + move    except EOFError:        # print(x, y)        print(x * y)        break
